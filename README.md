Pareto front quality parameters calculation

This code aims to calculate quality parameters for multi objective optimization obtained optimal solutions.
Obtaining the Pareto front, or set of efficienct optimal solutions, in Multi objective optimization problems can be very computationally demanding; which is why many meta-heuristic methods have been devised. Some methods might produce 'better' Pareto front approximations than other, which is why it is important to calculate and analyze relevant Pareto front quality indicators.

This code aims to estimate Pareto front quality indicators using Python 3 and assuming that the optimal values are inputed in .csv
